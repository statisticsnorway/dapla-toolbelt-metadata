# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving this project.
This project is open-source under the [MIT license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

- [Source Code]
- [Documentation]
- [Issue Tracker]
- [Code of Conduct]

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker].

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.10+ and the following tools:

- [uv]
- [Nox]
- nbstripout

### Install [pipx]

```console
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

### Install [uv]

Instructions: <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>

### Install [Nox]

```console
pipx install nox
```

### Install nbstripout

```console
pipx install nbstripout
```

### Install the pre-commit hooks

```console
nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

### Install the package with development requirements

```console
uv sync --dev
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to incorporate breaking model changes

We keep the version of `ssb-datadoc-model` pinned since almost all changes there are breaking changes and we don't want this package to be bumped accidentally. When upgrading the version of this package there are a number of things to consider:

1. Bump the package version
1. Run the tests and see what fails
1. Handle upgrading older document versions by adding code in: [src/dapla_metadata/datasets/compatibility](src/dapla_metadata/datasets/compatibility)
   1. Write a handler function to make the necessary changes
   1. Register the handler function as a `BackwardsCompatibleVersion` instance
   1. Add a metadata document under `tests/datasets/resources/existing_metadata_file/compatibility/v<YOUR_VERSION>` for use in testing.
1. Fix any source or test code which refers to outdated fields
1. Upgrade all the documents in the [tests/datasets/resources/existing_metadata_file](tests/datasets/resources/existing_metadata_file) directory (NOT those in the `compatibility` directory) to the latest version. This can be done using the script e.g. `uv run python bin/upgrade_metadata_file.py --path tests/datasets/resources/existing_metadata_file/person_data_v1__DOC.json`

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
